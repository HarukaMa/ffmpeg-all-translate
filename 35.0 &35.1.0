Timebase which will be used for timestamps of submitted frames. It must be either a floating-point number or in numerator/denominator form.

‘sample_rate’
The sample rate of the incoming audio buffers.

‘sample_fmt’
The sample format of the incoming audio buffers. Either a sample format name or its corresponging integer representation from the enum AVSampleFormat in ‘libavutil/samplefmt.h’

‘channel_layout’
The channel layout of the incoming audio buffers. Either a channel layout name from channel_layout_map in ‘libavutil/channel_layout.c’ or its corresponding integer representation from the AV_CH_LAYOUT_* macros in ‘libavutil/channel_layout.h’

‘channels’
The number of channels of the incoming audio buffers. If both channels and channel_layout are specified, then they must be consistent.
