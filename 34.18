34.18 aresample

Resample the input audio to the specified parameters, using the libswresample library. If none are specified then the filter will automatically convert between its input and output.

This filter is also able to stretch/squeeze the audio data to make it match the timestamps or to inject silence / cut out audio to make it match the timestamps, do a combination of both or do neither.

The filter accepts the syntax [sample_rate:]resampler_options, where sample_rate expresses a sample rate and resampler_options is a list of key=value pairs, separated by ":". See the ffmpeg-resampler manual for the complete list of supported options.

34.18.1 Examples
Resample the input audio to 44100Hz:
   
aresample=44100
Stretch/squeeze samples to the given timestamps, with a maximum of 1000 samples per second compensation:
 	
aresample=async=1000
