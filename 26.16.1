26.16.1 Options
‘draw_mouse’
Specify whether to draw the mouse pointer. A value of 0 specify not to draw the pointer. Default value is 1.

‘follow_mouse’
Make the grabbed area follow the mouse. The argument can be centered or a number of pixels PIXELS.

When it is specified with "centered", the grabbing region follows the mouse pointer and keeps the pointer at the center of region; otherwise, the region follows only when the mouse pointer reaches within PIXELS (greater than zero) to the edge of region.

For example:

   
ffmpeg -f x11grab -follow_mouse centered -r 25 -s cif -i :0.0 out.mpg
To follow only when the mouse pointer reaches within 100 pixels to edge:

 	
ffmpeg -f x11grab -follow_mouse 100 -r 25 -s cif -i :0.0 out.mpg
‘framerate’
Set the grabbing frame rate. Default value is ntsc, corresponding to a frame rate of 30000/1001.

‘show_region’
Show grabbed region on screen.

If show_region is specified with 1, then the grabbing region will be indicated on screen. With this option, it is easy to know what is being grabbed if only a portion of the screen is grabbed.

For example:

 	
ffmpeg -f x11grab -show_region 1 -r 25 -s cif -i :0.0+10,20 out.mpg
With follow_mouse:

 	
ffmpeg -f x11grab -follow_mouse centered -show_region 1 -r 25 -s cif -i :0.0 out.mpg
‘video_size’
Set the video frame size. Default value is vga.
