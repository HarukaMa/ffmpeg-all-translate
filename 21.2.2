21.2.2 Options
This demuxer accepts the following option:

‘safe’
If set to 1, reject unsafe file paths. A file path is considered safe if it does not contain a protocol specification and is relative and all components only contain characters from the portable character set (letters, digits, period, underscore and hyphen) and have no period at the beginning of a component.

If set to 0, any file name is accepted.

The default is -1, it is equivalent to 1 if the format was automatically probed and 0 otherwise.
