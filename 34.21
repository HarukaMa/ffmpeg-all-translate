Show a line containing various information for each input audio frame. The input audio is not modified.

The shown line contains a sequence of key/value pairs of the form key:value.

A description of each shown parameter follows:

‘n’
sequential number of the input frame, starting from 0

‘pts’
Presentation timestamp of the input frame, in time base units; the time base depends on the filter input pad, and is usually 1/sample_rate.

‘pts_time’
presentation timestamp of the input frame in seconds

‘pos’
position of the frame in the input stream, -1 if this information in unavailable and/or meaningless (for example in case of synthetic audio)

‘fmt’
sample format

‘chlayout’
channel layout

‘rate’
sample rate for the audio frame

‘nb_samples’
number of samples (per channel) in the frame

‘checksum’
Adler-32 checksum (printed in hexadecimal) of the audio data. For planar audio the data is treated as if all the planes were concatenated.

‘plane_checksums’
A list of Adler-32 checksums for each data plane.
