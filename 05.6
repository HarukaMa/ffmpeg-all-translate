5.6 Advanced Video Options

‘-pix_fmt[:stream_specifier] format (input/output,per-stream)’
Set pixel format. Use -pix_fmts to show all the supported pixel formats. If the selected pixel format can not be selected, ffmpeg will print a warning and select the best pixel format supported by the encoder. If pix_fmt is prefixed by a +, ffmpeg will exit with an error if the requested pixel format can not be selected, and automatic conversions inside filtergraphs are disabled. If pix_fmt is a single +, ffmpeg selects the same pixel format as the input (or graph output) and automatic conversions are disabled.

‘-sws_flags flags (input/output)’
Set SwScaler flags.

‘-vdt n’
Discard threshold.

‘-rc_override[:stream_specifier] override (output,per-stream)’
Rate control override for specific intervals, formatted as "int,int,int" list separated with slashes. Two first values are the beginning and end frame numbers, last one is quantizer to use if positive, or quality factor if negative.

‘-deinterlace’
Deinterlace pictures. This option is deprecated since the deinterlacing is very low quality. Use the yadif filter with -filter:v yadif.

‘-ilme’
Force interlacing support in encoder (MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 only). Use this option if your input file is interlaced and you want to keep the interlaced format for minimum losses. The alternative is to deinterlace the input stream with ‘-deinterlace’, but deinterlacing introduces losses.

‘-psnr’
Calculate PSNR of compressed frames.

‘-vstats’
Dump video coding statistics to ‘vstats_HHMMSS.log’.

‘-vstats_file file’
Dump video coding statistics to file.

‘-top[:stream_specifier] n (output,per-stream)’
top=1/bottom=0/auto=-1 field first

‘-dc precision’
Intra_dc_precision.

‘-vtag fourcc/tag (output)’
Force video tag/fourcc. This is an alias for -tag:v.

‘-qphist (global)’
Show QP histogram

‘-vbsf bitstream_filter’
Deprecated see -bsf

‘-force_key_frames[:stream_specifier] time[,time...] (output,per-stream)’
‘-force_key_frames[:stream_specifier] expr:expr (output,per-stream)’
Force key frames at the specified timestamps, more precisely at the first frames after each specified time.

If the argument is prefixed with expr:, the string expr is interpreted like an expression and is evaluated for each frame. A key frame is forced in case the evaluation is non-zero.

If one of the times is "chapters[delta]", it is expanded into the time of the beginning of all chapters in the file, shifted by delta, expressed as a time in seconds. This option can be useful to ensure that a seek point is present at a chapter mark or any other designated place in the output file.

For example, to insert a key frame at 5 minutes, plus key frames 0.1 second before the beginning of every chapter:

   
-force_key_frames 0:05:00,chapters-0.1
The expression in expr can contain the following constants:

‘n’
the number of current processed frame, starting from 0

‘n_forced’
the number of forced frames

‘prev_forced_n’
the number of the previous forced frame, it is NAN when no keyframe was forced yet

‘prev_forced_t’
the time of the previous forced frame, it is NAN when no keyframe was forced yet

‘t’
the time of the current processed frame

For example to force a key frame every 5 seconds, you can specify:

 	
-force_key_frames expr:gte(t,n_forced*5)
To force a key frame 5 seconds after the time of the last forced one, starting from second 13:

 	
-force_key_frames expr:if(isnan(prev_forced_t),gte(t,13),gte(t,prev_forced_t+5))
Note that forcing too many keyframes is very harmful for the lookahead algorithms of certain encoders: using fixed-GOP options or similar would be more efficient.

‘-copyinkf[:stream_specifier] (output,per-stream)’
When doing stream copy, copy also non-key frames found at the beginning.
