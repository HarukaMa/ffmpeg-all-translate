34.31 resample

Convert the audio sample format, sample rate and channel layout. This filter is not meant to be used directly.

34.32 volume

Adjust the input audio volume.

The filter accepts the following options:

‘volume’
Expresses how the audio volume will be increased or decreased.

Output values are clipped to the maximum value.

The output audio volume is given by the relation:

   
output_volume = volume * input_volume
Default value for volume is 1.0.

‘precision’
Set the mathematical precision.

This determines which input sample formats will be allowed, which affects the precision of the volume scaling.

‘fixed’
8-bit fixed-point; limits input sample format to U8, S16, and S32.

‘float’
32-bit floating-point; limits input sample format to FLT. (default)

‘double’
64-bit floating-point; limits input sample format to DBL.
