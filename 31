31. graph2dot

The ‘graph2dot’ program included in the FFmpeg ‘tools’ directory can be used to parse a filtergraph description and issue a corresponding textual representation in the dot language.

Invoke the command:

   
graph2dot -h
to see how to use ‘graph2dot’.

You can then pass the dot description to the ‘dot’ program (from the graphviz suite of programs) and obtain a graphical representation of the filtergraph.

For example the sequence of commands:

 	
echo GRAPH_DESCRIPTION | \
tools/graph2dot -o graph.tmp && \
dot -Tpng graph.tmp -o graph.png && \
display graph.png
can be used to create and display an image representing the graph described by the GRAPH_DESCRIPTION string. Note that this string must be a complete self-contained graph, with its inputs and outputs explicitly defined. For example if your command line is of the form:

 	
ffmpeg -i infile -vf scale=640:360 outfile
your GRAPH_DESCRIPTION string will need to be of the form:

 	
nullsrc,scale=640:360,nullsink
you may also need to set the nullsrc parameters and add a format filter in order to simulate a specific input file.
