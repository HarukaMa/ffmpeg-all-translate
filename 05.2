5.2 Generic options

These options are shared amongst the ff* tools.

‘-L’
Show license.

‘-h, -?, -help, --help [arg]’
Show help. An optional parameter may be specified to print help about a specific item.

Possible values of arg are:

‘decoder=decoder_name’
Print detailed information about the decoder named decoder_name. Use the ‘-decoders’ option to get a list of all decoders.

‘encoder=encoder_name’
Print detailed information about the encoder named encoder_name. Use the ‘-encoders’ option to get a list of all encoders.

‘demuxer=demuxer_name’
Print detailed information about the demuxer named demuxer_name. Use the ‘-formats’ option to get a list of all demuxers and muxers.

‘muxer=muxer_name’
Print detailed information about the muxer named muxer_name. Use the ‘-formats’ option to get a list of all muxers and demuxers.

‘filter=filter_name’
Print detailed information about the filter name filter_name. Use the ‘-filters’ option to get a list of all filters.

‘-version’
Show version.

‘-formats’
Show available formats.

‘-codecs’
Show all codecs known to libavcodec.

Note that the term ’codec’ is used throughout this documentation as a shortcut for what is more correctly called a media bitstream format.

‘-decoders’
Show available decoders.

‘-encoders’
Show all available encoders.

‘-bsfs’
Show available bitstream filters.

‘-protocols’
Show available protocols.

‘-filters’
Show available libavfilter filters.

‘-pix_fmts’
Show available pixel formats.

‘-sample_fmts’
Show available sample formats.

‘-layouts’
Show channel names and standard channel layouts.

‘-loglevel [repeat+]loglevel | -v [repeat+]loglevel’
Set the logging level used by the library. Adding "repeat+" indicates that repeated log output should not be compressed to the first line and the "Last message repeated n times" line will be omitted. "repeat" can also be used alone. If "repeat" is used alone, and with no prior loglevel set, the default loglevel will be used. If multiple loglevel parameters are given, using ’repeat’ will not change the loglevel. loglevel is a number or a string containing one of the following values:

‘quiet’
Show nothing at all; be silent.

‘panic’
Only show fatal errors which could lead the process to crash, such as and assert failure. This is not currently used for anything.

‘fatal’
Only show fatal errors. These are errors after which the process absolutely cannot continue after.

‘error’
Show all errors, including ones which can be recovered from.

‘warning’
Show all warnings and errors. Any message related to possibly incorrect or unexpected events will be shown.

‘info’
Show informative messages during processing. This is in addition to warnings and errors. This is the default value.

‘verbose’
Same as info, except more verbose.

‘debug’
Show everything, including debugging information.

By default the program logs to stderr, if coloring is supported by the terminal, colors are used to mark errors and warnings. Log coloring can be disabled setting the environment variable AV_LOG_FORCE_NOCOLOR or NO_COLOR, or can be forced setting the environment variable AV_LOG_FORCE_COLOR. The use of the environment variable NO_COLOR is deprecated and will be dropped in a following FFmpeg version.

‘-report’
Dump full command line and console output to a file named program-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log in the current directory. This file can be useful for bug reports. It also implies -loglevel verbose.

Setting the environment variable FFREPORT to any value has the same effect. If the value is a ’:’-separated key=value sequence, these options will affect the report; options values must be escaped if they contain special characters or the options delimiter ’:’ (see the “Quoting and escaping” section in the ffmpeg-utils manual). The following option is recognized:

‘file’
set the file name to use for the report; %p is expanded to the name of the program, %t is expanded to a timestamp, %% is expanded to a plain %

Errors in parsing the environment variable are not fatal, and will not appear in the report.

‘-cpuflags flags (global)’
Allows setting and clearing cpu flags. This option is intended for testing. Do not use it unless you know what you’re doing.

   
ffmpeg -cpuflags -sse+mmx ...
ffmpeg -cpuflags mmx ...
ffmpeg -cpuflags 0 ...

‘-opencl_options options (global)’
Set OpenCL environment options. This option is only available when FFmpeg has been compiled with --enable-opencl.

options must be a list of key=value option pairs separated by ’:’. See the “OpenCL Options” section in the ffmpeg-utils manual for the list of supported options.
