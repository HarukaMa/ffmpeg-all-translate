Linux DV 1394 input device.

26.5 fbdev

Linux framebuffer input device.

The Linux framebuffer is a graphic hardware-independent abstraction layer to show graphics on a computer monitor, typically on the console. It is accessed through a file device node, usually ‘/dev/fb0’.

For more detailed information read the file Documentation/fb/framebuffer.txt included in the Linux source tree.

To record from the framebuffer device ‘/dev/fb0’ with ffmpeg:

   
ffmpeg -f fbdev -r 10 -i /dev/fb0 out.avi
You can take a single screenshot image with the command:

 	
ffmpeg -f fbdev -frames:v 1 -r 1 -i /dev/fb0 screenshot.jpeg
