24.4 file

File access protocol.

Allow to read from or read to a file.

For example to read from a file ‘input.mpeg’ with ffmpeg use the command:

   
ffmpeg -i file:input.mpeg output.mpeg
The ff* tools default to the file protocol, that is a resource specified with the name "FILE.mpeg" is interpreted as the URL "file:FILE.mpeg".
