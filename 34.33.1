34.33.1 Examples
Here is an excerpt of the output:

   
[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] mean_volume: -27 dB
[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] max_volume: -4 dB
[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_4db: 6
[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_5db: 62
[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_6db: 286
[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_7db: 1042
[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_8db: 2551
[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_9db: 4609
[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_10db: 8409
It means that:

The mean square energy is approximately -27 dB, or 10^-2.7.
The largest sample is at -4 dB, or more precisely between -4 dB and -5 dB.
There are 6 samples at -4 dB, 62 at -5 dB, 286 at -6 dB, etc.
In other words, raising the volume by +4 dB does not cause any clipping, raising it by +5 dB causes clipping for 6 samples, etc.
