22.10 null

Null muxer.

This muxer does not generate any output file, it is mainly useful for testing or benchmarking purposes.

For example to benchmark decoding with ffmpeg you can use the command:

   
ffmpeg -benchmark -i INPUT -f null out.null
Note that the above command does not read or write the ‘out.null’ file, but specifying the output file is required by the ffmpeg syntax.

Alternatively you can write the command as:

 	
ffmpeg -benchmark -i INPUT -f null -
