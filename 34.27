Synchronize audio data with timestamps by squeezing/stretching it and/or dropping samples/adding silence when needed.

This filter is not built by default, please use aresample to do squeezing/stretching.

The filter accepts the following named parameters:

‘compensate’
Enable stretching/squeezing the data to make it match the timestamps. Disabled by default. When disabled, time gaps are covered with silence.

‘min_delta’
Minimum difference between timestamps and audio data (in seconds) to trigger adding/dropping samples. Default value is 0.1. If you get non-perfect sync with this filter, try setting this parameter to 0.

‘max_comp’
Maximum compensation in samples per second. Relevant only with compensate=1. Default value 500.

‘first_pts’
Assume the first pts should be this value. The time base is 1 / sample rate. This allows for padding/trimming at the start of stream. By default, no assumption is made about the first frame’s expected pts, so no padding or trimming is done. For example, this could be set to 0 to pad the beginning with silence if an audio stream starts after the video stream or to trim any samples with a negative pts due to encoder delay.
