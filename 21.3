21.3 libquvi

Play media from Internet services using the quvi project.

The demuxer accepts a ‘format’ option to request a specific quality. It is by default set to best.

See http://quvi.sourceforge.net/ for more information.

FFmpeg needs to be built with --enable-libquvi for this demuxer to be enabled.
