34.12 aformat

Set output format constraints for the input audio. The framework will negotiate the most appropriate format to minimize conversions.

The filter accepts the following named parameters:

‘sample_fmts’
A ’|’-separated list of requested sample formats.

‘sample_rates’
A ’|’-separated list of requested sample rates.

‘channel_layouts’
A ’|’-separated list of requested channel layouts.

If a parameter is omitted, all values are allowed.

For example to force the output to either unsigned 8-bit or signed 16-bit stereo:

   
aformat=sample_fmts=u8|s16:channel_layouts=stereo
