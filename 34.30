34.30 join

Join multiple input streams into one multi-channel stream.

The filter accepts the following named parameters:

‘inputs’
Number of input streams. Defaults to 2.

‘channel_layout’
Desired output channel layout. Defaults to stereo.

‘map’
Map channels from inputs to output. The argument is a ’|’-separated list of mappings, each in the input_idx.in_channel-out_channel form. input_idx is the 0-based index of the input stream. in_channel can be either the name of the input channel (e.g. FL for front left) or its index in the specified input stream. out_channel is the name of the output channel.

The filter will attempt to guess the mappings when those are not specified explicitly. It does so by first trying to find an unused matching input channel and if that fails it picks the first unused input channel.

E.g. to join 3 inputs (with properly set channel layouts)

   
ffmpeg -i INPUT1 -i INPUT2 -i INPUT3 -filter_complex join=inputs=3 OUTPUT
To build a 5.1 output from 6 single-channel streams:

 	
ffmpeg -i fl -i fr -i fc -i sl -i sr -i lfe -filter_complex
'join=inputs=6:channel_layout=5.1:map=0.0-FL|1.0-FR|2.0-FC|3.0-SL|4.0-SR|5.0-LFE'
out
