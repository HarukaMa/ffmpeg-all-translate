34.29 channelmap

Remap input channels to new locations.

This filter accepts the following named parameters:

‘channel_layout’
Channel layout of the output stream.

‘map’
Map channels from input to output. The argument is a ’|’-separated list of mappings, each in the in_channel-out_channel or in_channel form. in_channel can be either the name of the input channel (e.g. FL for front left) or its index in the input channel layout. out_channel is the name of the output channel or its index in the output channel layout. If out_channel is not given then it is implicitly an index, starting with zero and increasing by one for each mapping.

If no mapping is present, the filter will implicitly map input channels to output channels preserving index.

For example, assuming a 5.1+downmix input MOV file

   
ffmpeg -i in.mov -filter 'channelmap=map=DL-FL|DR-FR' out.wav
will create an output WAV file tagged as stereo from the downmix channels of the input.

To fix a 5.1 WAV improperly encoded in AAC’s native channel order

 	
ffmpeg -i in.wav -filter 'channelmap=1|2|0|5|3|4:channel_layout=5.1' out.wav
