24.2 concat

Physical concatenation protocol.

Allow to read and seek from many resource in sequence as if they were a unique resource.

A URL accepted by this protocol has the syntax:

   
concat:URL1|URL2|...|URLN
where URL1, URL2, ..., URLN are the urls of the resource to be concatenated, each one possibly specifying a distinct protocol.

For example to read a sequence of files ‘split1.mpeg’, ‘split2.mpeg’, ‘split3.mpeg’ with ffplay use the command:

 	
ffplay concat:split1.mpeg\|split2.mpeg\|split3.mpeg
Note that you may need to escape the character "|" which is special for many shells.
