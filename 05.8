5.8 Advanced Audio options:

‘-atag fourcc/tag (output)’
Force audio tag/fourcc. This is an alias for -tag:a.

‘-absf bitstream_filter’
Deprecated, see -bsf

‘-guess_layout_max channels (input,per-stream)’
If some input channel layout is not known, try to guess only if it corresponds to at most the specified number of channels. For example, 2 tells to ffmpeg to recognize 1 channel as mono and 2 channels as stereo but not 6 channels as 5.1. The default is to always try to guess. Use 0 to disable all guessing.
