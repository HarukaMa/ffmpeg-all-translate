34.3 highpass

Apply a high-pass filter with 3dB point frequency. The filter can be either single-pole, or double-pole (the default). The filter roll off at 6dB per pole per octave (20dB per pole per decade).

The filter accepts the following options:

‘frequency, f’
Set frequency in Hz. Default is 3000.

‘poles, p’
Set number of poles. Default is 2.

‘width_type’
Set method to specify band-width of filter.

‘h’
Hz

‘q’
Q-Factor

‘o’
octave

‘s’
slope

‘width, w’
Specify the band-width of a filter in width_type units. Applies only to double-pole filter. The default is 0.707q and gives a Butterworth response.
