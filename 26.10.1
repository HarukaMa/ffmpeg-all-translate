26.10.2 Examples
Print the list of OpenAL supported devices and exit:

   
$ ffmpeg -list_devices true -f openal -i dummy out.ogg
Capture from the OpenAL device ‘DR-BT101 via PulseAudio’:

 	
$ ffmpeg -f openal -i 'DR-BT101 via PulseAudio' out.ogg
Capture from the default device (note the empty string ” as filename):

 	
$ ffmpeg -f openal -i '' out.ogg
Capture from two devices simultaneously, writing to two different files, within the same ffmpeg command:

 	
$ ffmpeg -f openal -i 'DR-BT101 via PulseAudio' out1.ogg -f openal -i 'ALSA Default' out2.ogg
Note: not all OpenAL implementations support multiple simultaneous capture - try the latest OpenAL Soft if the above does not work.
