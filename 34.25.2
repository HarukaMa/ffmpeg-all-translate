34.25.2 Remapping examples
The channel remapping will be effective if, and only if:

gain coefficients are zeroes or ones,
only one input per channel output,
If all these conditions are satisfied, the filter will notify the user ("Pure channel mapping detected"), and use an optimized and lossless method to do the remapping.

For example, if you have a 5.1 source and want a stereo audio stream by dropping the extra channels:

   
pan="stereo: c0=FL : c1=FR"
Given the same source, you can also switch front left and front right channels and keep the input channel layout:

 	
pan="5.1: c0=c1 : c1=c0 : c2=c2 : c3=c3 : c4=c4 : c5=c5"
If the input is a stereo audio stream, you can mute the front left channel (and still keep the stereo channel layout) with:

 	
pan="stereo:c1=c1"
Still with a stereo audio stream input, you can copy the right channel in both front left and right:

 	
pan="stereo: c0=FR : c1=FR"
