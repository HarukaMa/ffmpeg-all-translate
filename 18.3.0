18.3 libx264

x264 H.264/MPEG-4 AVC encoder wrapper

Requires the presence of the libx264 headers and library during configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with --enable-libx264.

x264 supports an impressive number of features, including 8x8 and 4x4 adaptive spatial transform, adaptive B-frame placement, CAVLC/CABAC entropy coding, interlacing (MBAFF), lossless mode, psy optimizations for detail retention (adaptive quantization, psy-RD, psy-trellis).

The FFmpeg wrapper provides a mapping for most of them using global options that match those of the encoders and provides private options for the unique encoder options. Additionally an expert override is provided to directly pass a list of key=value tuples as accepted by x264_param_parse.
