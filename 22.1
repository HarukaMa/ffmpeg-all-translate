22.1 crc

CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) testing format.

This muxer computes and prints the Adler-32 CRC of all the input audio and video frames. By default audio frames are converted to signed 16-bit raw audio and video frames to raw video before computing the CRC.

The output of the muxer consists of a single line of the form: CRC=0xCRC, where CRC is a hexadecimal number 0-padded to 8 digits containing the CRC for all the decoded input frames.

For example to compute the CRC of the input, and store it in the file ‘out.crc’:

   
ffmpeg -i INPUT -f crc out.crc
You can print the CRC to stdout with the command:

 	
ffmpeg -i INPUT -f crc -
You can select the output format of each frame with ffmpeg by specifying the audio and video codec and format. For example to compute the CRC of the input audio converted to PCM unsigned 8-bit and the input video converted to MPEG-2 video, use the command:

 	
ffmpeg -i INPUT -c:a pcm_u8 -c:v mpeg2video -f crc -
