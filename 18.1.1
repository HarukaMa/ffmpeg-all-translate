18.1.1 Options
The following global options are mapped to internal libtheora options which affect the quality and the bitrate of the encoded stream.

‘b’
Set the video bitrate, only works if the qscale flag in ‘flags’ is not enabled.

‘flags’
Used to enable constant quality mode encoding through the ‘qscale’ flag, and to enable the pass1 and pass2 modes.

‘g’
Set the GOP size.

‘global_quality’
Set the global quality in lambda units, only works if the qscale flag in ‘flags’ is enabled. The value is clipped in the [0 - 10*FF_QP2LAMBDA] range, and then multiplied for 6.3 to get a value in the native libtheora range [0-63]. A higher value corresponds to a higher quality.

For example, to set maximum constant quality encoding with ffmpeg:

   
ffmpeg -i INPUT -flags:v qscale -global_quality:v "10*QP2LAMBDA" -codec:v libtheora OUTPUT.ogg
18.2 libvpx

VP8 format supported through libvpx.

Requires the presence of the libvpx headers and library during configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with --enable-libvpx.
