8.7 Color

It can be the name of a color (case insensitive match) or a [0x|#]RRGGBB[AA] sequence, possibly followed by "@" and a string representing the alpha component.

The alpha component may be a string composed by "0x" followed by an hexadecimal number or a decimal number between 0.0 and 1.0, which represents the opacity value (0x00/0.0 means completely transparent, 0xff/1.0 completely opaque). If the alpha component is not specified then 0xff is assumed.

The string "random" will result in a random color.
