24.22 tcp

Trasmission Control Protocol.

The required syntax for a TCP url is:

   
tcp://hostname:port[?options]
‘listen’
Listen for an incoming connection

‘timeout=microseconds’
In read mode: if no data arrived in more than this time interval, raise error. In write mode: if socket cannot be written in more than this time interval, raise error. This also sets timeout on TCP connection establishing.

 	
ffmpeg -i input -f format tcp://hostname:port?listen
ffplay tcp://hostname:port
