The MP3 muxer writes a raw MP3 stream with an ID3v2 header at the beginning and optionally an ID3v1 tag at the end. ID3v2.3 and ID3v2.4 are supported, the id3v2_version option controls which one is used. The legacy ID3v1 tag is not written by default, but may be enabled with the write_id3v1 option.

For seekable output the muxer also writes a Xing frame at the beginning, which contains the number of frames in the file. It is useful for computing duration of VBR files.

The muxer supports writing ID3v2 attached pictures (APIC frames). The pictures are supplied to the muxer in form of a video stream with a single packet. There can be any number of those streams, each will correspond to a single APIC frame. The stream metadata tags title and comment map to APIC description and picture type respectively. See http://id3.org/id3v2.4.0-frames for allowed picture types.

Note that the APIC frames must be written at the beginning, so the muxer will buffer the audio frames until it gets all the pictures. It is therefore advised to provide the pictures as soon as possible to avoid excessive buffering.

Examples:

Write an mp3 with an ID3v2.3 header and an ID3v1 footer:

   
ffmpeg -i INPUT -id3v2_version 3 -write_id3v1 1 out.mp3
To attach a picture to an mp3 file select both the audio and the picture stream with map:

 	
ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -i cover.png -c copy -map 0 -map 1
-metadata:s:v title="Album cover" -metadata:s:v comment="Cover (Front)" out.mp3
