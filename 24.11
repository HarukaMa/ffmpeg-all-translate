24.11 pipe

UNIX pipe access protocol.

Allow to read and write from UNIX pipes.

The accepted syntax is:

   
pipe:[number]
number is the number corresponding to the file descriptor of the pipe (e.g. 0 for stdin, 1 for stdout, 2 for stderr). If number is not specified, by default the stdout file descriptor will be used for writing, stdin for reading.

For example to read from stdin with ffmpeg:

 	
cat test.wav | ffmpeg -i pipe:0
# ...this is the same as...
cat test.wav | ffmpeg -i pipe:
For writing to stdout with ffmpeg:

 	
ffmpeg -i test.wav -f avi pipe:1 | cat > test.avi
# ...this is the same as...
ffmpeg -i test.wav -f avi pipe: | cat > test.avi
Note that some formats (typically MOV), require the output protocol to be seekable, so they will fail with the pipe output protocol.
