34.7 bandpass

Apply a two-pole Butterworth band-pass filter with central frequency frequency, and (3dB-point) band-width width. The csg option selects a constant skirt gain (peak gain = Q) instead of the default: constant 0dB peak gain. The filter roll off at 6dB per octave (20dB per decade).

The filter accepts the following options:

‘frequency, f’
Set the filter’s central frequency. Default is 3000.

‘csg’
Constant skirt gain if set to 1. Defaults to 0.

‘width_type’
Set method to specify band-width of filter.

‘h’
Hz

‘q’
Q-Factor

‘o’
octave

‘s’
slope

‘width, w’
Specify the band-width of a filter in width_type units.
