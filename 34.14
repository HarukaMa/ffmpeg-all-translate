34.14 amix

Mixes multiple audio inputs into a single output.

For example

   
ffmpeg -i INPUT1 -i INPUT2 -i INPUT3 -filter_complex amix=inputs=3:duration=first:dropout_transition=3 OUTPUT
will mix 3 input audio streams to a single output with the same duration as the first input and a dropout transition time of 3 seconds.

The filter accepts the following named parameters:

‘inputs’
Number of inputs. If unspecified, it defaults to 2.

‘duration’
How to determine the end-of-stream.

‘longest’
Duration of longest input. (default)

‘shortest’
Duration of shortest input.

‘first’
Duration of first input.

‘dropout_transition’
Transition time, in seconds, for volume renormalization when an input stream ends. The default value is 2 seconds.
