18.4.2 Speed considerations
In the default mode of operation the encoder has to honor frame constraints (i.e. not produc frames with size bigger than requested) while still making output picture as good as possible. A frame containing a lot of small details is harder to compress and the encoder would spend more time searching for appropriate quantizers for each slice.

Setting a higher ‘bits_per_mb’ limit will improve the speed.

For the fastest encoding speed set the ‘qscale’ parameter (4 is the recommended value) and do not set a size constraint.
