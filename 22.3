22.3 framemd5

Per-packet MD5 testing format.

This muxer computes and prints the MD5 hash for each audio and video packet. By default audio frames are converted to signed 16-bit raw audio and video frames to raw video before computing the hash.

The output of the muxer consists of a line for each audio and video packet of the form:

   
stream_index, packet_dts, packet_pts, packet_duration, packet_size, MD5
MD5 is a hexadecimal number representing the computed MD5 hash for the packet.

For example to compute the MD5 of the audio and video frames in ‘INPUT’, converted to raw audio and video packets, and store it in the file ‘out.md5’:

 	
ffmpeg -i INPUT -f framemd5 out.md5
To print the information to stdout, use the command:

 	
ffmpeg -i INPUT -f framemd5 -
