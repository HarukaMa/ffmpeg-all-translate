Mix channels with specific gain levels. The filter accepts the output channel layout followed by a set of channels definitions.

This filter is also designed to remap efficiently the channels of an audio stream.

The filter accepts parameters of the form: "l:outdef:outdef:..."

‘l’
output channel layout or number of channels

‘outdef’
output channel specification, of the form: "out_name=[gain*]in_name[+[gain*]in_name...]"

‘out_name’
output channel to define, either a channel name (FL, FR, etc.) or a channel number (c0, c1, etc.)

‘gain’
multiplicative coefficient for the channel, 1 leaving the volume unchanged

‘in_name’
input channel to use, see out_name for details; it is not possible to mix named and numbered input channels

If the ‘=’ in a channel specification is replaced by ‘<’, then the gains for that specification will be renormalized so that the total is 1, thus avoiding clipping noise.
