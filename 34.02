34.2 allpass

Apply a two-pole all-pass filter with central frequency (in Hz) frequency, and filter-width width. An all-pass filter changes the audio’s frequency to phase relationship without changing its frequency to amplitude relationship.

The filter accepts the following options:

‘frequency, f’
Set frequency in Hz.

‘width_type’
Set method to specify band-width of filter.

‘h’
Hz

‘q’
Q-Factor

‘o’
octave

‘s’
slope

‘width, w’
Specify the band-width of a filter in width_type units.
