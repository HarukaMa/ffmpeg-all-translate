7.1 Preset files

A preset file contains a sequence of option=value pairs, one for each line, specifying a sequence of options which can be specified also on the command line. Lines starting with the hash (’#’) character are ignored and are used to provide comments. Empty lines are also ignored. Check the ‘presets’ directory in the FFmpeg source tree for examples.

Preset files are specified with the pre option, this option takes a preset name as input. FFmpeg searches for a file named preset_name.avpreset in the directories ‘$AVCONV_DATADIR’ (if set), and ‘$HOME/.ffmpeg’, and in the data directory defined at configuration time (usually ‘$PREFIX/share/ffmpeg’) in that order. For example, if the argument is libx264-max, it will search for the file ‘libx264-max.avpreset’.
