26.14 video4linux2, v4l2

Video4Linux2 input video device.

"v4l2" can be used as alias for "video4linux2".

If FFmpeg is built with v4l-utils support (by using the --enable-libv4l2 configure option), the device will always rely on libv4l2.

The name of the device to grab is a file device node, usually Linux systems tend to automatically create such nodes when the device (e.g. an USB webcam) is plugged into the system, and has a name of the kind ‘/dev/videoN’, where N is a number associated to the device.

Video4Linux2 devices usually support a limited set of widthxheight sizes and frame rates. You can check which are supported using -list_formats all for Video4Linux2 devices. Some devices, like TV cards, support one or more standards. It is possible to list all the supported standards using -list_standards all.

The time base for the timestamps is 1 microsecond. Depending on the kernel version and configuration, the timestamps may be derived from the real time clock (origin at the Unix Epoch) or the monotonic clock (origin usually at boot time, unaffected by NTP or manual changes to the clock). The ‘-timestamps abs’ or ‘-ts abs’ option can be used to force conversion into the real time clock.
Grab and show the input of a video4linux2 device:
    
ffplay -f video4linux2 -framerate 30 -video_size hd720 /dev/video0
Grab and record the input of a video4linux2 device, leave the frame rate and size as previously set:
   
ffmpeg -f video4linux2 -input_format mjpeg -i /dev/video0 out.mpeg
