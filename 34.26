34.26 silencedetect

Detect silence in an audio stream.

This filter logs a message when it detects that the input audio volume is less or equal to a noise tolerance value for a duration greater or equal to the minimum detected noise duration.

The printed times and duration are expressed in seconds.

The filter accepts the following options:

‘duration, d’
Set silence duration until notification (default is 2 seconds).

‘noise, n’
Set noise tolerance. Can be specified in dB (in case "dB" is appended to the specified value) or amplitude ratio. Default is -60dB, or 0.001.

34.26.1 Examples
Detect 5 seconds of silence with -50dB noise tolerance:
   
silencedetect=n=-50dB:d=5
Complete example with ffmpeg to detect silence with 0.0001 noise tolerance in ‘silence.mp3’:
 	
ffmpeg -i silence.mp3 -af silencedetect=noise=0.0001 -f null -
