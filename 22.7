22.7 md5

MD5 testing format.

This muxer computes and prints the MD5 hash of all the input audio and video frames. By default audio frames are converted to signed 16-bit raw audio and video frames to raw video before computing the hash.

The output of the muxer consists of a single line of the form: MD5=MD5, where MD5 is a hexadecimal number representing the computed MD5 hash.

For example to compute the MD5 hash of the input converted to raw audio and video, and store it in the file ‘out.md5’:

   
ffmpeg -i INPUT -f md5 out.md5
You can print the MD5 to stdout with the command:

 	
ffmpeg -i INPUT -f md5 -
