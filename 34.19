34.19 asetnsamples

Set the number of samples per each output audio frame.

The last output packet may contain a different number of samples, as the filter will flush all the remaining samples when the input audio signal its end.

The filter accepts the following options:

‘nb_out_samples, n’
Set the number of frames per each output audio frame. The number is intended as the number of samples per each channel. Default value is 1024.

‘pad, p’
If set to 1, the filter will pad the last audio frame with zeroes, so that the last frame will contain the same number of samples as the previous ones. Default value is 1.

For example, to set the number of per-frame samples to 1234 and disable padding for the last frame, use:

   
asetnsamples=n=1234:p=0
