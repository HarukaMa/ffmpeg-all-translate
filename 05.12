5.12 Preset files

A preset file contains a sequence of option=value pairs, one for each line, specifying a sequence of options which would be awkward to specify on the command line. Lines starting with the hash (’#’) character are ignored and are used to provide comments. Check the ‘presets’ directory in the FFmpeg source tree for examples.

Preset files are specified with the vpre, apre, spre, and fpre options. The fpre option takes the filename of the preset instead of a preset name as input and can be used for any kind of codec. For the vpre, apre, and spre options, the options specified in a preset file are applied to the currently selected codec of the same type as the preset option.

The argument passed to the vpre, apre, and spre preset options identifies the preset file to use according to the following rules:

First ffmpeg searches for a file named arg.ffpreset in the directories ‘$FFMPEG_DATADIR’ (if set), and ‘$HOME/.ffmpeg’, and in the datadir defined at configuration time (usually ‘PREFIX/share/ffmpeg’) or in a ‘ffpresets’ folder along the executable on win32, in that order. For example, if the argument is libvpx-1080p, it will search for the file ‘libvpx-1080p.ffpreset’.

If no such file is found, then ffmpeg will search for a file named codec_name-arg.ffpreset in the above-mentioned directories, where codec_name is the name of the codec to which the preset file options will be applied. For example, if you select the video codec with -vcodec libvpx and use -vpre 1080p, then it will search for the file ‘libvpx-1080p.ffpreset’.
