26.2 bktr

BSD video input device.

26.3 dshow

Windows DirectShow input device.

DirectShow support is enabled when FFmpeg is built with the mingw-w64 project. Currently only audio and video devices are supported.

Multiple devices may be opened as separate inputs, but they may also be opened on the same input, which should improve synchronism between them.

The input name should be in the format:

   
TYPE=NAME[:TYPE=NAME]
where TYPE can be either audio or video, and NAME is the deviceâ€™s name.
