8.1.1 Examples
Escape the string Crime d'Amour containing the ' special character:
   
Crime d\'Amour
The string above contains a quote, so the ' needs to be escaped when quoting it:
 	
'Crime d'\''Amour'
Include leading or trailing whitespaces using quoting:
 	
'  this string starts and ends with whitespaces  '
Escaping and quoting can be mixed together:
 	
' The string '\'string\'' is a string '
To include a literal \ you can use either escaping or quoting:
 	
'c:\foo' can be written as c:\\foo
