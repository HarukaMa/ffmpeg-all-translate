34.6 treble

Boost or cut treble (upper) frequencies of the audio using a two-pole shelving filter with a response similar to that of a standard hi-fi’s tone-controls. This is also known as shelving equalisation (EQ).

The filter accepts the following options:

‘gain, g’
Give the gain at whichever is the lower of ~22 kHz and the Nyquist frequency. Its useful range is about -20 (for a large cut) to +20 (for a large boost). Beware of clipping when using a positive gain.

‘frequency, f’
Set the filter’s central frequency and so can be used to extend or reduce the frequency range to be boosted or cut. The default value is 3000 Hz.

‘width_type’
Set method to specify band-width of filter.

‘h’
Hz

‘q’
Q-Factor

‘o’
octave

‘s’
slope

‘width, w’
Determine how steep is the filter’s shelf transition.
