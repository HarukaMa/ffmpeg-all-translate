21.2.1 Syntax
The script is a text file in extended-ASCII, with one directive per line. Empty lines, leading spaces and lines starting with ’#’ are ignored. The following directive is recognized:

‘file path’
Path to a file to read; special characters and spaces must be escaped with backslash or single quotes.

All subsequent directives apply to that file.

‘ffconcat version 1.0’
Identify the script type and version. It also sets the ‘safe’ option to 1 if it was to its default -1.

To make FFmpeg recognize the format automatically, this directive must appears exactly as is (no extra space or byte-order-mark) on the very first line of the script.

‘duration dur’
Duration of the file. This information can be specified from the file; specifying it here may be more efficient or help if the information from the file is not available or accurate.

If the duration is set for all files, then it is possible to seek in the whole concatenated video.
